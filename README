A test app to show a monkey patch on a model will persist in dev mode on multiple refreshes, troubleshooting this not happening in one of our apps.

rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rails s
http://localhost:3000/monkeys # should say monkey monkey monkey
refresh, patch in initializers/patch.rb still works
